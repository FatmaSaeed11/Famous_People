		<h1> Da Vinci's life </h1> 
			<div class="text_2">
					Leonardo was born out of wedlock to notary Piero da Vinci and a peasant woman named Caterina in Vinci in the region of Florence, and he was 
					educated in the studio of Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan.
					He later worked in Rome, Bologna, and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I.

					In January 1478, Leonardo received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio, an indication of his
					independence from Verrocchio's studio. One anonymous writer claims that in 1480, Leonardo was living with the Medici and often worked in the garden of the Piazza 
					San Marco, Florence, where a Neoplatonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers organized by the Medici met.
					<br>
					In March 1481, he received a commission from the monks of San Donato in Scopeto for The Adoration of the Magi. Neither of these initial commissions were completed, being abandoned when Leonardo went to offer his 
					services to Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza. In 1482, he casted a silver stringed instrument from a horse's skull and ram horns to bring to Sforza, whom he wrote a letter
					describing the diverse things that he could achieve in the fields of engineering and weapon design, and mentioning that he could paint.<br>
					<br><br>
					<a href="images/azraa.jpg"data-lightbox="gallery"><img class="three" src="images/azraa.jpg"height="150" width="200"></a>
					Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper
					for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Sforza to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned
					by him to paint a Madonna. Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, including the preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions, a drawing and wooden 
					model for a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral (which he withdrew), 
					and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico's predecessor Francesco Sforza. This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in  Padua and 
					Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the Gran Cavallo.
					Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the bronze to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles VIII.
					
			</div>
			
			<div class="text_2">
					In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of 
					<a href="images/horse.jpg"data-lightbox="gallery"><img class="eng" src="images/horse.jpg"height="150" width="200"></a>
					
					Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola in order to win his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military 
					engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map
					in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons. <br><br>	
					Leonardo had left Borgia's service and returned to Florence by early 1503, where he rejoined the Guild of Saint Luke on 18 October of that year. By this same month, Leonardo had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo,
					the model for the Mona Lisa, which he would continue working on until his twilight years. In January 1504, he was part of a committee formed to recommend where Michelangelo's statue of David should be placed. He then spent
					two years in Florence designing and painting a mural of The Battle of Anghiari for the Signoria, with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, The Battle of Cascina.<br> <br> <br>
					In 1506, Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d'Amboise, the acting French governor of the city. The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish The Battle of Anghiari, but he was given leave at 
					the behest of Louis XII, who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits. Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d'Amboise; a wax model survives and, if genuine, is the only
					extant example of Leonardo's sculpture. Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests. Many of Leonardo's most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan, including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio
					Boltraffio, and Marco d'Oggiono. In 1507, Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father, who had died in 1504. By 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in
					the parish of Santa Babila.<br> <br> <br>

		<h1> Personal life </h1><br> 
			<div class="text_2" >
					Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "outstanding physical beauty," "infinite grace," "great strength and generosity," "regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind," as described by Vasari, as well as all
					other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his vegetarianism and his habit, according to Vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.
					<br>  
					Leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance. They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli,[103] with whom he collaborated on the book Divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have
					had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to 
					create a painted portrait, now lost.
					<br> 		
					Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud.
					Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 
					16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. 
					The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Since that date much has
					been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.

					During his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer. With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy. 
					  Leonardo studied and designed a bewildering number of machines and devices. 
				
				He drew their “anatomy” with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected "exploded view" technique, to represent internal components. 

				 Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages. In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan.<br><br>

					Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege.
					When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499. he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect<br> the city from attack.

				<br>	<br>In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked.

					He continued to contemplate the canalization of Lombardy's	plains while in Louis XII's company and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I.

					 Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps,reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.
